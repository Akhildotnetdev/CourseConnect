# CourseConnect

Application Summary:
As a student I always faced issue in planning my semester, the current process is to identify the course know the professor try to contact him, and now you need to wait for his available time to get details about the course.
To solve that issue of students and professor, by an efficient tool which can assist students in getting to know more about courses and also can view what are comments from other students on the courses. He will also have the option to post a comment and also view video comments posted by other users.
Currently the admin will have options to manager creating users / professor accounts. He will generate the user IDâ€™s and assign the appropriate roles to those users (Professors / Students). Admin will have access to the entire courses database where he can change the details of the existing courses. 
Professors are currently restricted on a condition that they can have only one class as of now, for which they can update the details.
As a complete website, this is the best application that can connect the gaps between students and professors to get more details about courses. (CourseConnect)
